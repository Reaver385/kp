* option for build "--bump" which bumps the minor release, i.e. 1%{?dist} becomes 1%{?dist}.1, or 1%{?dist}.1 becomes 1%{?dist}.2

* option for build "--version" to specify the version to build, e.g.  ./src/kp --config conf/kp-csmart.conf build --version=2.1.2 mozilla-adblock-plus
this would update the kp config and also the spec file (and reset any minor version), adding appropriate %changelog entry, e.g. "Update to version 2.1.2"

* option for build "--commit" to automatically commit changes in kp and package git repos on successful build

* check that version in kp config matches the version in spec files

* if version you're building already exists in repo, warn

* add a checksum for downloads and check this against existing tarballs, and post download
